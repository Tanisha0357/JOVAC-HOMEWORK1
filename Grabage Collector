The Garbage Collector (GC) in JavaScript is an automatic memory management feature
 that detects and removes data no longer in use. By freeing up unused memory, 
it ensures applications run efficiently and helps prevent memory leaks or performance 
issues.

--How the Garbage Collector Works:-
The Mark-and-Sweep algorithm is a memory management technique used in JavaScript 
to automatically clean up unused objects. It works by identifying which objects are still 
accessible (reachable) and safely discarding those that are no longer needed, freeing up
 memory in the process.
This approach ensures efficient memory usage by marking active objects and then 
sweeping away the inactive ones.

--Benefits of Garbage Collection in JavaScript--
:-Handles Memory Automatically – Developers don’t need to manually manage memory allocation or deallocation.
:-Minimizes Memory Leaks – Automatically removes unused objects, reducing the chances of memory buildup.
:-Enhances Performance – Keeps applications efficient by cleaning up memory that’s no longer in use.
:-Boosts Code Safety – Prevents issues like invalid memory access or accidental overwrites.
:-Simplifies Development – Takes care of complex memory tasks behind the scenes, making coding easier.

Example:
function displayMessage() {
  let note = { text: "Garbage Collector!" };
  console.log(note.text); // Output:  Garbage Collector!
  // 'note' becomes unreachable after the function finishes
}
displayMessage();
